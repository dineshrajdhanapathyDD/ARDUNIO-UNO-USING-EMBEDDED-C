# ARDUNIO-UNO-USING-EMBEDDED-C
BASIC  PROJECTS AND DESIGN OF ARDUNIO UNO KIT

Here's a basic guide for getting started with the Arduino Uno 

Step 1: Setting up the Arduino Uno

Connect the Arduino Uno board to your computer using a USB cable.
Install the Arduino Software (IDE) from the official Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). Choose the appropriate version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

Step 2: Open the Arduino IDE

Launch the Arduino IDE after installation.
Make sure the correct Arduino board is selected. Go to "Tools" > "Board" and select "Arduino Uno."
Ensure the correct port is selected. Go to "Tools" > "Port" and choose the port to which the Arduino Uno is connected.

Step 3: Write the Code

Open a new sketch by clicking on "File" > "New."
Write or copy the code to read the [PROJECT] file. Arduino Uno is not designed for reading text files directly, so you would need to store the contents of the [PROJECT] file within the code itself as a string variable.

Step 4: Upload the Code

Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer if it isn't already connected.
Click on the "Upload" button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to the Arduino Uno.


Step 5: Monitor the Serial Output

After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor by clicking on "Tools" > "Serial Monitor" or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+M.
Set the baud rate in the Serial Monitor to match the one specified in the code (in this case, 9600).
You should see the contents of the [PROJECT] file being printed repeatedly in the Serial Monitor.

You have successfully read the contents of a [PROJECT] file using Arduino Uno. Remember that Arduino Uno has limited memory, so make sure the [PROJECT] file content fits within its available resources.
